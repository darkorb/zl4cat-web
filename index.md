### ZL4CAT

I log via QRZ, LoTW, eQSL. No direct, sorry.

Contact info is on QRZ or email qrz@ this domain.

I tend to be around on FT8 (mostly 20/40), SSTV, DMR etc. though my current project is for working with APRS while my HF gear is offline (weather damage to the antenna & poles).

Why ZL4CAT? Well this is my Tamar when she was a few months old, she's a Devon Rex and joined our assorted fur family around 2016 - I'm very much "crazy cat man" according to those familar with me, hence ZL4CAT :)
