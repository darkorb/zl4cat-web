### ZL4CAT

I log via QRZ, LoTW, eQSL. No direct, sorry.

Contact info is qrz@ this domain.

I tend to be around on FT8 (mostly 20/40), SSTV - however due to weather damage to my HF antenna/poles in Aug/Sept 2021 my current projects are with APRS and I'm on ZL DMR/National Repeaters until I get around to getting things fixed up.

Why ZL4CAT? Well this is my Tamar when she was a few months old, she's a Devon Rex and joined our assorted fur family around 2016 - I'm very much "crazy cat man" according to those familar with me, hence ZL4CAT :) She joined the three we already had in the house and is fully part of our family.
