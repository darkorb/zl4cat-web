### ZL4CAT

I log via QRZ, LoTW, eQSL. No direct, sorry.

Contact info is on QRZ or email qrz@ this domain.

I tend to be around on FT8, SSTV, DMR etc. though my current project being for APRS while my HF gear is offline (space issues and weather damage).

Why the ZL4CAT? Well this is my Tamar when she was a few months old, she's a Devon Rex and joined our assorted fur family around 2016 - I'm very much "crazy cat man" according to those familar with me, hence ZL4CAT :)
